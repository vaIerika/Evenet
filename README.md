### Fuctionality of the App
1. Generate an individual QR code with personal data 
*(name, phone number, email, workplace)*
2. Scan QR codes of other users and save their data in DocumentsDirectory of the user 
3. Illustrate saved data in the list
4. Allow user to separate contacted people from those who weren't contacted
5. Create notifications by user's request
